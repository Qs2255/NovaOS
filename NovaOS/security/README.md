# NovaOS Security

Security is central to NovaOS. We aim for a transparent, auditable, and user-controlled system.

### Core Principles
- No telemetry or background data collection.
- Open-source security model.
- Full user root access (with warnings and safe mode).
- Encrypted system partitions and sandboxed app layers.

### Reporting
Report vulnerabilities responsibly via GitHub security advisories or email: coming soon
