# NovaOS — The Freedom Operating System

## 🌍 Vision
NovaOS is an open-source, privacy-first mobile operating system designed for true user control.  
No ads, no trackers, no telemetry — just pure performance and full transparency.  

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Full Root Access** — safely available to advanced users with transparency.
- **Privacy by Design** — zero data collection or corporate dependency.
- **Android App Support** — via an independent, sandboxed compatibility layer.
- **Lightweight Kernel** — optimized for performance, modularity, and battery life.
- **Community-Driven** — open development and governance by contributors worldwide.

## 🔒 Root Policy
Root access is a right — not a privilege. NovaOS includes a transparent root policy:  
1. Root is disabled by default for safety.  
2. Users can enable it manually after setup.  
3. All root actions are logged and reversible.

## 🧠 Long-Term Goals
- Develop an independent Linux-based kernel (non-AOSP).  
- Create an open app store for FOSS developers.  
- Introduce advanced sandboxing for security.  
- Build a transparent governance system.
